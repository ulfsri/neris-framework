# NERIS Data Framework
This repository contains the data framework, currently in beta, for the National Emergency Response Information System (NERIS). This includes the Entity Specification for Fire Departments, Dispatch (CAD) Data Schema, and the Incident Data Schema. The schemas are broken down into modules and value sets. Modules define the data elements (i.e., what is being asked) and value sets are choices users can select (i.e., the choices in the drop down). Two file formats are included for ease of use: csv and yml.

## Additional information
Additional information about the framework, including Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and module flow schematics, can be found in [this repo's wiki](https://github.com/ulfsri/neris-framework/wiki).
