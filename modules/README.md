## modules

This metadata is a descriptive representation of the data elements in NERIS modules. Modules serve as the high-level sets of data elements to be collected for an incident response.

The metadata tables in `modules/` contain some or all of the following fields:
- `name`
    - Text
    - The field's name.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `type`
    - Text
    - The field's data type.
    - Aligned to standard PostgreSQL and PostGIS types.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `group` 
    - Text
    - The field's within-module group.
    - Used for blocks of fields which logically move together, such as for conditionality or repeatability.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `possible_if`
    - Text
    - For fields that should only be populated under certain conditions, the logic of those conditions.
    - E.g. `conditions_fire_nonfire = 'fire'` indicates that the field should only have a value if `conditions_fire_nonfire` has a value of `'fire'`
    - Must be populated for fields whose availability is conditional.
- `db_required`
    - Boolean
    - Whether the field should always contain a not null value. To allow NERIS to be maximally accepting of submitted data, this should only be `TRUE` for the fields required for a minimally viable record, and for those that are calculated in a way that naturally leads to a default value (such as aggregated counts, which default to 0).  
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `neris_core_if`
    - Text
    - The logical conditions under which any of the `neris_core` fields may apply.
    - Must be populated for all fields whose `neris_core_dependency` is conditional.
- `neris_core`
    - Boolean
    - Does not apply to `core_mod_disp`.
    - Whether the field is required for the record to be considered minimally complete within NERIS.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `neris_core_aid`
    - Boolean
    - Does not apply to `core_mod_disp`.
    - Whether the field is considered core for incidents in which the reporting department was giving mutual aid, or was giving automatic aid and was not the primary. 
    - Must be populated for all fields within Dispatch and Incidents.
- `neris_core_app`
    - Boolean
    - Only applies to `core_mod_disp`.
    - Whether the field is required for a record submitted by app (non-CAD) to be considered minimally complete within NERIS.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `neris_core_cad`
    - Boolean
    - Only applies to `core_mod_disp`.
    - Whether the field is required for a record submitted by CAD to be considered minimally complete within NERIS.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `computed`
    - Boolean
    - Whether the field is populated by NERIS via post-processing.
    - Those marked `TRUE` do not require directy submission by departments or other user organizations.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `computed_from`
    - Text
    - The data element(s) from which the field is post-processed.
    - Must be populated for fields with `computed` = `TRUE`
- `cardinality`
    - Text
    - Whether the field is a single value (`Single`) or an array (`Multi`) for a given record.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `value_set`
    - Boolean
    - Whether the value must be a member of a pre-determined set of acceptable values.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `reference_location`
    - Text
    - The location of the referenced `value_set` or module.
    - Must be populated for any field for which `value_set = TRUE`.
- `map_orm_landing`
    - Text
    - The field or logic for where the field's data is found within the Landing Zzone Python Object Relational Mapping models.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `map_app`
    - Text
    - The field or logic for where the field's data is found within the Survey123 XLSForm.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `description`
    - Text
    - A descriptive explanation of what the field contains.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `example`
    - Text
    - An example of the data the field may contain.
    - Must be populated for all fields.
- `comments`
    - Text
    - Comments on the logic or constraints on what the field may contain.
    - Must be populated for fields needing comment only.
